# unRAID Universal Plugin (32 & 64 Bit)
This repo hosts the unRAID universal plugin I've created. This based on the Headphones plugin from -=PhAzE=-. I transformed it so it would install Lazylibrarian. This should be comaptible with both unRAID 5 and 6.

You will find the plugin file under the Plugins directory, and all the control and dependency files for each app are under the AppSupport folder.

You only require the plugin file to install these on your unRAID server, and the control and dependency files will be automatically downloaded.
